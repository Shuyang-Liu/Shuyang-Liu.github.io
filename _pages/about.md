# About me

Hi! I am a fourth-year undergraduate at the [School of Computer Science & Technology](http://english.cs.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Security, focusing on developing data-driven program analysis to improve the security and reliability of software systems. I also get excited about Programming Languages.

# Education

- B.Eng. Huazhong University of Science and Technology
  - 2020-2024 (expected)
  - GPA: 3.92/4.00

# Research Experience
## Exploiting Code Symmetries for Learning Program Semantics
[Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), 2023.3 - 2023.9  
- Mentor: [Kexin Pei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XzSkny0AAAAJ&hl=en)  
- Advisor: [Suman Jana](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SDY9FwUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)  
- Duties: Employed Tree-sitter to construct PDGs based on data/control dependencies between statements; Implemented 9 semantic-preserving source code transformations beyond PDG automorphisms; Evaluated baselines for Java method name prediction, which performs an “extreme summarization” of the function behavior.

## Token-Level Static Program Analysis
[University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), 2023.9 - Present
- Advisor: [Kexin Pei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XzSkny0AAAAJ&hl=en)
- Duties: Type Inference for Python; Extract dependencies between tokens.

## Automatic identification of Bug Inducing Commits
[CASTLE Lab @HKUST](http://castle.cse.ust.hk/castle/index.html), 2022.10 - Present  
- Mentor: Xiao Chen  
- Advisor: [Ming Wen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ht2MknAAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Duties: Systematically validated bug-fixing and associated bug-inducing commits for 237 bugs across 5 large open-source Java projects; Employed the bisection method for precise identification; Reproduced SZZ Unleashed algorithm and its variant.

# Academic Projects
## Real-time Traffic Sign Recognition System
[National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), 2022.5 - 2022.8
- Role: Student Team **Leader**
- Advisor: [Terence Sim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AdEsZwsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)
- Duties: Constructed and tuned a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow Keras; Implemented a suite of innovative data augmentations, notably Random Erasing, strategically erasing regions within input images to heighten model robustness and generalize to diverse scenarios.

# Honors
-  Excellent Student Cadre (2020)
-  Model Student of Academic Records (2021)
-  Technology Innovation Scholarship (2022)
-  Social Welfare Scholarship (2023)

# Hobbies
- Music, a major fan of Taylor Swift. Also like Lana Del Rey and Coldplay :)
- Member of TGD, HUST 3C club. Occasionally participate in BP debates.
